/**
 * Represents the client-side implementation of a block-based Immersive implementation.
 * <br>
 * To clarify what an Immersive is, from the user's perspective, an Immersive is a single category of thing that
 * ImmersiveMC supports. Whether that be furnaces, throwing, or petting, those are all considered Immersives.
 * <br>
 * From a programming perspective, the term Immersive is used to represent a few different concepts:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The aforementioned user definition of an Immersive.</li>
 *     <li>The aforementioned user definition of an Immersive, but only for implementations that take advantage
 *     of this interface. This is also referred to as a block-based Immersive.</li>
 *     <li>The client-side exclusive logic of a block-based Immersive.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The final entry on that list is what this interface is; "The client-side exclusive logic of a block-based Immersive."
 * Developers implement this interface to create the client-side implementation of a block-based Immersive (or,
 * alternatively, build one using an {@link ImmersiveBuilder}). When combined with a {@link ImmersiveHandler}, you have
 * a fully-functioning (block-based) Immersive!
 * @param <I> The {@link ImmersiveInfo} implementation this Immersive uses.
 * @param <S> The type of storage to use for sending Immersive data over the network.

     * handle the block, as it is no longer a furnace. As another example, if this Immersive represented a furnace, and
