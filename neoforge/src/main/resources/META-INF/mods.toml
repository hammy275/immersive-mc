Minimizes the need to interact with GUIs in Minecraft!

Works great both in and out of VR!

Requires the MC VR API mod if you want to use this the best in VR!

Thanks to NahNotFox for the bundle bag model (the default) and the written book texture!

Thanks to:
- andreiqwer for adding support for resizing item guides and a bugfix!
- yaosiqian for Simplified Chinese translations!
- Yermak for the Russian translations!
- DadoSpeedy for the German translations!

Thanks to the Vivecraft developers for inspiration for the backpack, and to various members of the ImmersiveMC Discord for ideas!
