## Requirements

ImmersiveMC has a few requirements:

- [Architectury API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-api) if you're playing ImmersiveMC 1.18.2 Beta 2 or higher.
- [mc-vr-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api) if you're playing in VR.
- [Forge Config API Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric) if you're playing under Fabric.

Additionally, ImmersiveMC (and its requirements) **must be installed on BOTH the server and client to use it!**

## What is it?

The goal of ImmersiveMC is to make Minecraft more immersive! It most obviously does this by minimizing the amount of GUIs you need to interact with.

You can use things such as the crafting table, furnaces, and brewing stands without having to open a GUI, and even more when you're in VR!

## VR?

There's VR support! In fact, this mod was primarily built to make VR a better experience!

You'll need my API mod, [mc-vr-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api) to use this in VR. With this mod installed, you'll be able to use your actual hands to place items, instead of just right clicking!

## NOTE

**ImmersiveMC is needed on both the server and the client! ImmersiveMC is *NOT* a client-side only mod!**

Future Versions of Minecraft: Coming Soon!

Fabric: Fabric support is here! With Vivecraft supporting both Forge and Fabric, it only makes sense for ImmersiveMC to, too! Fabric is supported starting with ImmersiveMC 1.18.2 Beta 2.

Other/Older Versions: There are no plans to backport ImmerisveMC to older versions of Minecraft, nor are there any plans to port it to minor versions of Minecraft that have newer versions. For example, there are no plans to port ImmersiveMC to 1.18.1, as 1.18.2 already exists.
